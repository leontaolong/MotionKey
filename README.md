# MotionKey
The mobility of mobile phones and tablets affords the opportunity to develop novel user experiences or enable unique forms of user input. For this project, I harnessed device's built-in sensors to implement a motion-based software keyboard that allows the user to "type" (in a limited fashionâ€”say, producing one of a few different emojis by moving their device around.

## User Stories

The user stories for the MotionKey app are:

+ As a user, I want to "type" text content (including emojis!) by just moving my phone
+ As a user, I want to see feedback about how my phone motion is producing content
+ As a user, I want to adjust the motion sensitivity to fit my hardware
